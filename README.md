## My process

- First y make all the structure in HTML (div, container, card and text).
- Then start to styling with simple css, from top to bottom.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I leaned to make an image to fit in a card and manage css properties.
Also leanred to manage display flex properly.


### Continued development

I want to improve my css abilities because I had some troubles with the sizes and how display property works.
